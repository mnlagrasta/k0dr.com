# Overview

The Desklights project is an ambient information display built into a desk. The desk receives real time data and event notifications via network connection and alters it's colors and patterns to provide glanceable information. It's real world uses include infrastructure monitoring, communication notifications, backlog visualizations, heat maps, assistive displays, and more. The software is entirely open source and the hardware is easily sourced and very scalable.
