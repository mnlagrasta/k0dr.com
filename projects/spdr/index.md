# Overview

I've always wanted to make a large robot costume for halloween. So I couldn't resist when my daughter suggested she trick or treat as Peni Parker and I as her robot, SP//dr.

# Completed photos

Photos of completed (more like ran out of time than completed) costume:

# Build Log

I've got some photos and notes from various parts of the process which I will upload here shortly.
