title: I made a SP//dr Costume
---

I've always wanted to make a large robot costume for halloween. So I couldn't resist when my daughter suggested she trick or treat as Peni Parker and I as her robot, SP//dr.

I'll be posting more details as I can get them organized and written down. The basic version is this: EVA foam, 2 flexible LED matrices, an Arduino Mega, many cans of plasti-dip and spray paint, and way too much contact cement.
