I've always wanted to create a site just for my open source projects. However, I have always hesitated to create it myself due to existence of established sites such as Instructables and Make::Projects (when it was around...is it back now?).

I've created the site now for two reasons:

 1. I'd like all my projects to have a consolidated and consistent home. This will provide an easy index to various other sites such as Instructables, GitHub, YouTube, etc.
 1. I want to use it myself as a build log and note space as I work and to preserve this for later reference. This is obviously different than what I would polish up and show as a finished result.

And so I present (mostly for myself, but you are welcome to peruse) K0DR.com
