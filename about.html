<h1>About k0dr.com</h1>
<p>
This site is just a place for me to post information about the various projects that I work on. It functions largely as my own personal build log. This means that, especially in the case of "Active" projects, the updates will be sporadic and a bit messy. I'll try to clean up each project's docs as they near completion.

<p>
Almost all of the content will be open source and you can always feel free to contact me for more details.
