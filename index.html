	<h1>Hello</h1>
	<p>
	This site is just a place for me to post information about the various projects that I work on. It functions largely as my own personal build log. This means that, especially in the case of "Active" projects, the updates will be sporadic and a bit messy. I'll try to clean up each project's docs as they near completion.
	</p>
	<p>
	Whenever possible, the content will be open source and you can always feel free to contact me for more details.
	</p>

	For information about me see: <a href="https://lagrasta.com">LaGrasta.com</a>
